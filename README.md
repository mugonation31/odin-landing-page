# odin-landing-page

This is my Landing Page project from TOP.

This project i will be demonstrating a variety of skills that I have picked up on HTML and CSS.

Things like how to create a HTML page from scratch and then style it using CSS.

When I complete this project I should have demonstrated the following 

- create HTML page using HTML tags 
- structure my page following the normal flow methodology
- use css to style my HTML page 
- display property to manipulate and change normal flow with values such as block, inline-block etc
- use the box model effectively to style, re-size and position elements - using padding, border 
and margin 
- use flex-box to create fluid designs and achieve desire design patterns

By the end of this project I should have the confidence to recreate any design using the above skill.
